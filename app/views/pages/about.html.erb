        <p>For almost eight years, I worked in the fashion industry. Over that time, I have seen the industry shift and change, becoming increasingly more focused on e-commerce and digital service. For two years, I ran the e-commerce website at the handbag company I worked for and, in the process, had the opportunity to assist in a full site redesign. As I was working with the developers and making recommendations for features, it dawned on me that I didn't want to be working with the developers; I wanted to be the developer.</p>

        <p>My first introduction to coding came in high school; I took a few classes in JavaScript and Visual Basic. I also taught myself HTML and CSS by building and designing the make-your-own websites (such as Angelfire, Xanga, and Geocities) that were popular at the time. I had always enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of coding and working on the site redesign reinspired that interest in me.</p>

        <p>Over the next few months, I took a few online courses on sites such as Code Academy, Udemy, and Code School. I realized that I was spending all of my free time working on code and thoroughly enjoying it! I reached out to a few people in my network and discussed options for truly learning to code. It was suggested to me to look into coding bootcamps. After much research, I landed at the Flatiron School, an intense, immersive coding bootcamp. For three months, I worked harder than I have ever worked. We covered a tremendous amount of information including, but not limited to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>RUBY</li>
          <li>RUBY ON RAILS</li>
          <li>RUBY ON SINATRA</li>
          <li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
          <li>EMBER.JS</li>
          <li>HTML/CSS</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My 'aha!' moment came when I realized that I was spending roughly 15 hours a day coding (in class, working on projects, etc.) and was so excited to come back do it all again the next day.</p>
